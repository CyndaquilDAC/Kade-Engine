wow wow kazow! you found a fairly easy to find text document!
in all seriousness, either you were lucky and found this on your own or you listened to the hint i gave and went through every single folder.
if you have no idea what im talking about, i'm talking about "enabledEasterEggs.txt" in the data folder.
yeah. heres a little cheatsheet
switch-healthheads - enables pressing 9 to toggle between the old bf health heads.
ascend - enables the ascension easter egg. the character that the camera is focused on is flown up! what a revolution!
probably more to come but im fucking STUPID so i havent come up with other ones lolmao
